              Social networks are commonly associated with distraction and
              division. Dyad, a local social network, aims to emphasize the
              transitory behavior of human interaction by placing restric- tions
              on both the geographical distance and the permanence of posts. In
              order to encourage user interaction, it will connect users that
              are nearby like a mesh network that requires users to be near each
              other to even transfer data between devices. The purpose of this
              is to fuel conversation between users that are already in the same
              area. It could be getting updates at a large venue during an
              concert, or sharing events in a classroom. Another concern with
              social networks is their privacy. <br/>
              Most messages and posts on
              social media can be retrieved by the relevant companies even when
              theyâ€™ve been deleted. With our peer-to-peer network implementation
              of Dyad, there will be no user data on offsite servers and
              personal information will be encrypted as much as possible. Dyad
              will try to be what current major social networks are not while
              still doing basically the same thing. We have a huge focus on
              reliability and security and giving our users the power to control
              their own data, which is not the case of the most prominent social
              networking applications today.
