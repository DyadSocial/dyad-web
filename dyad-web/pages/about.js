      <div className={styles["description-body"]}>
          <p>
            Social networks are commonly associated with distraction and
            division. Dyad, a local social network, aims to emphasize the
            transitory behavior of human interaction by placing restric- tions
            on both the geographical distance and the permanence of posts. In
            order to encourage user interaction, it will connect users that are
            nearby like a mesh network that requires users to be near each other
            to even transfer data between devices. The purpose of this is to
            fuel conversation between users that are already in the same area.
            It could be getting updates at a large venue during an concert, or
            sharing events in a classroom. Another concern with social networks
            is their privacy. Most messages and posts on social media can be
            retrieved by the relevant companies even when theyâ€™ve been deleted.
            With our peer-to-peer network implementation of Dyad, there will be
            no user data on offsite servers and personal information will be
            encrypted as much as possible. Dyad will try to be what current
            major social networks are not while still doing basically the same
            thing. We have a huge focus on reliability and security and giving
            our users the power to control their own data, which is not the case
            of the most prominent social networking applications today.
